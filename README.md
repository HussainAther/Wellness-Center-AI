# Wellness Center AI Project

This repository contains the source code, assets, and documentation for the **Wellness Center AI Project**, designed to allow user avatars to move and interact in a shared virtual space. The project leverages **Unity** for its development environment and integrates AI-driven data extrapolation to support developmental analysis.

## Features

1. **Basic Movement Mechanics**:
   - User avatars can navigate a shared virtual environment using intuitive movement controls.
   - Multiplayer synchronization allows interactions between avatars in real-time.

2. **AI-Driven Data Extrapolation**:
   - Tracks interaction patterns, movement paths, and other behavioral data.
   - Provides actionable insights for developmental analysis using AI models.

3. **Customizable Virtual Environment**:
   - Supports real-time modifications for tailored experiences by educators and professionals.

## Directory Structure

- **Assets**:
  - Contains Unity scenes, scripts, and prefabs for the Wellness Center.
- **AI-Models**:
  - Includes pre-trained AI models and documentation for data analysis.
- **Data-Pipeline**:
  - Components for collecting, storing, and analyzing user interaction data.
- **Documentation**:
  - Guides and notes on project setup, design decisions, and testing plans.
